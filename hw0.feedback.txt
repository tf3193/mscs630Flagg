Troy,

- Good job in creating your accounts!

- Good job in setting up your java compiler in your system.

- Good job with your first GitHub submission!

- Good organization of your repository! :)

- Excellent!

However,
** Please, if the repo is public, remove your labs; I don't want other students
   being able to use your code to cheat in the assignments. The submission site
   will always keep a copy for you anyway.


Peace,

- Dr. Pablo Rivas
